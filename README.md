# Treasach-Raytracer
I just learnt C++ in one uni course and learnt about raytracers in another. Let's combine both in a forever-unfinished project!

I originally wanted to name the project "Tracy", but since others have done this, I named it in line with the ancestry of the 
Irish surname "Tracey" instead. [According to Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_(name))
> The name is taken from the Irish word "treasach" meaning "war-like" or "fighter".

Also, *sach* is close to the Dutch *zag*, the simple past of *zien* ("to see"), which is fitting for a raytracer.
